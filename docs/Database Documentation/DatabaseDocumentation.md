# Database Documentation

The purpose of this database is to be a store of information in the form of notes and index cards collected by users doing research in any variety of field.

**Note:** Diagrams and documentation are subject to change. At this early stage the material is largely scratchwork. As the design matures more formalized documentation will be available.
